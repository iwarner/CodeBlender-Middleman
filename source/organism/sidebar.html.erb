        I like to use a module file structure, so all the files can be found within
        the following directory on GitHub:

    %p.text-center
        %a{ href: "https://github.com/iwarner/CodeBlender-Middleman/tree/master/source/organism/sidebar" }
            = codeBlender "icon", "atom", { icon: "fa-github fa-fw" }
            Code

:markdown

    ### Notes

    - Would set up a caching system for this JSON into localstorage as I cant see the menu change a lot
        - Or manifest it
    - Probably do not need 'leaf', as if menu is null thats enough
    - For open JavaScript I would usually use :
        - A template library like handlebars
        - Or AngularJS these days
        - Or create statically in Middleman, prototype and changes required
    - Guess the in Mobile | Full site should be split links, so would explode on pipe
    - I would refactor the creation of the menu more but there is enough difference to not bother for a prototype
        - Would recurse through a single method to create the UL lists and contents
    - Would usually create cross browser hasClass but for prototype, .contains is fine
    - Expand the menu - would probably work some toggle() in here instead of if else but satisficed
    - Would make more responsive by use of bootsrap classes
    - Browser compatability - tested on Chrome, for prototypes this is my dev browser of choice

-# Bootstrap row
.row

    -# Bootstrap column
    .col-md-6

        -# Panel body
        - panelBody = capture_html do

            -# Markdown
            :markdown

                The gallery is a collection of cards, that can be either drawn
                from :

                - A data file
                - Collection of blogs
                - Iterating over an image folder

                The following example is simply scanning the whole images directory
                and creating a thumbnail gallery of the contents.

        -# Panel
        = codeBlender "panel", "molecule", { body: panelBody, heading: { text: "Introduction" } }

    -# Bootstrap column
    .col-md-6

        -# Panel body - markdown
        - panelBody = capture_html do

            -#Â Markdown
            :markdown

                To be completed...

        -# Panel
        = codeBlender "panel", "molecule", { body: panelBody, heading: { text: "Setup" } }

-# Bootstrap row
.row

    .col-md-12

        %br

        -# Create Array
        - thumbnails = []

        -# Loop through Image Resources
        - sitemap.resources.select { | r | [ ".png", ".jpg" ].include?( r.ext ) and ! r.path.scan( "assets/images" ).empty? }.each do | resource |

            -# URL
            - src = resource.url.sub! "/assets/images/", ""

            -# Append to Thumbnails Array
            - if src
                - thumbnails << { image:     { extraClass: "img-responsive", src: src },
                                  thumbnail: { href: src, zoomix: true } }

        -# Thumbnails
        = codeBlender "thumbnail", "molecule", { array: thumbnails, columns: "col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4", rowClass: "gallery" }

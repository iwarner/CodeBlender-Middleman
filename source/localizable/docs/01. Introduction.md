### CAVEATS

#### PHP 5.4

If there are any pre-existing pear install outside of homebrew-php, and you are
using a non-standard pear.conf location, installation may fail.

For 10.5 and Apache:
    Apache needs to run in 32-bit mode. You can either force Apache to start
    in 32-bit mode or you can thin the Apache executable.

To enable PHP in Apache add the following to httpd.conf and restart Apache:
    LoadModule php5_module /usr/local/Cellar/php54/5.4.6/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so

The php.ini file can be found in:
    /usr/local/etc/php/5.4/php.ini

PEAR

If pear complains about permissions, 'Fix' the default PEAR permissions and config:
    chmod -R ug+w /usr/local/Cellar/php54/5.4.6/lib/php
    pear config-set php_ini /usr/local/etc/php/5.4/php.ini

Extensions

If you are having issues with custom extension compiling, ensure that this php is
in your PATH:
    PATH="$(brew --prefix josegonzalez/php/php54)/bin:$PATH"

Extensions will never be compiled against this homebrew-php PHP. Please install them
using --with-homebrew-php to enable compiling against this php.

FPM

If you have installed the formula with --with-fpm, to launch php-fpm on startup:
    * If this is your first install:
        mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
        cp /usr/local/Cellar/php54/5.4.6/homebrew-php.josegonzalez.php54.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
        launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew-php.josegonzalez.php54.plist

    * If this is an upgrade and you already have the homebrew-php.josegonzalez.php54.plist loaded:
        launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew-php.josegonzalez.php54.plist
        cp /usr/local/Cellar/php54/5.4.6/homebrew-php.josegonzalez.php54.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
        launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew-php.josegonzalez.php54.plist

Mountain Lion comes with php-fpm pre-installed, to ensure you are using the brew version you need to make sure /usr/local/sbin is before /usr/sbin in your PATH:

  PATH="/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"

You may also need to edit the plist to use the correct "UserName".

Please note that the plist was called 'org.php-fpm.plist' in old versions of this formula.

#### MySQL

brew info mysql

## TODO

* Re-Order the .osx file so that any items that need configuring are at the top
** Or provide an extension file if possible
* Document Setup.sh more - list what it does
* Homebrew Script should install HomeBrew too
* Remove PEAR and PHP from current Mac system
* PEAR Upgrade and Install useful packages such as PHPUnit and XDEBUG
* Create more wiki pages with Documentation for each script
* Install Vagrant through the ruby gems
* Make sure the directories are not hard coded

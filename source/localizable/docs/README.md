## Introduction

VISA TMS Mobile Application and Website Development

These docs assume the following:

1. That you are using an Apple Mac computer
2. Familiar with the Terminal and running commands through it.

This application utilises [Middleman][] (MM) as a Static site generator. MM is
built on top of Ruby, so installation steps will be required.

Code is written within Middleman in [CoffeeScript][], [HAML][] and [SCSS][].
Understanding of these technologies is necessary.

Ruby programming may be required for working with the helpers in the codebase.

NB// The $ in front of the commands simply defines them as Bash do not copy and
paste these into the terminal.

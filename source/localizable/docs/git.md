## Introduction

The next task to tackle is how we get the latest files for the project. These
should all be contained within a [GIT][] repository.

The project manager will setup the required account. You should then be able to
find and use the SSH Clone URL

Once the project is cloned, it will automatically look for the Library files
in the correct location, test that these do in Sublime.

## Todo

* More information on Commit, Pull, Push, Merge and Branch
* Set up the GIT server on the MAC OSX Server
* Look at using GIT Flow

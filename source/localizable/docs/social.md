## Introduction

### Social

* Add in Facebook Connect
* Social buttons need the full attributes available to them
* Sort out button positioning when in-line - i.e. Facebook - twitter should line up
* Create a partial that includes loops through a data array of buttons required
* URLs can be derived from canonical URL so make sure this is in place
* Facebook Locales should be handled outside of config.yaml it could get long.
    * Automate this more.

## Introduction

Trawling the many hundreds of job sites can be time consuming and non-productive.
Below I will attempt to consolidate my process in looking for a new technical job
in the UK; or more precisely in London.

Having spent twenty years in development, and most of that as a contractor. I have
learnt some ways to expedite the process of gaining visibility, searching and also
the best sites to update to gain recruiter exposure.

## CW Jobs

- [CWJobs](http://www.cwjobs.co.uk/)
- [PHP](http://www.cwjobs.co.uk/JobSearch/Results.aspx?Keywords=php&JobType1=20&LTxt=London&Radius=10)
- [Angular](http://www.cwjobs.co.uk/JobSearch/Results.aspx?Keywords=angular&JobType1=20&LTxt=London&Radius=10)
- [Remote](http://www.cwjobs.co.uk/JobSearch/Results.aspx?Keywords=remote&JobType1=20)

CW is my go to destination when looking for a new contract. It seems to have one
of the most thorough databases, and I also believe quality recruitment agents subscribe
to the database. So when I literally update my details I am pinged to all these
recruiters for matches against the jobs they have.

The job alerts via email are also a very good option, but they do have a feature
called instant job match, which will email you a relevant job as soon as it is listed.

    Angular | London | Contract = 60 vacancies
    PHP     | London | Contract = 22 vacancies
    Remote  | London | Contract = 24 vacancies

CW also has a nice quick apply once your profile is complete successfully.

No specific search for remote jobs unfortunately.

## TechnoJobs

- [TechnoJobs](https://www.technojobs.co.uk/)
- [Remote](https://www.technojobs.co.uk/search.phtml/remote/searchfield/location/radius/salary/jobtypecontract)

Registration and profile completion on this site is easy. Giving access to a good
search engine and plenty of varied jobs across all sectors. I personally like the
job alerts from this site; setting up the following.

    Angular | London | Contract = 29 vacancies
    PHP     | London | Contract = 20 vacancies

No specific search for remote jobs unfortunately.

I also like the quick apply option, powerful when the CV and cover email is already
completed.

However I have not had much traction from the jobs applied from this site. On asking
where recruiters found my details few are from here.

##Â Startups

## Remote

- [Working Nomads](http://www.workingnomads.co/)
Saturated with US jobs, that usually require the candidate to be in the same timezone.
Would be great if they provided a filter for this.

- [Authentic Jobs](https://authenticjobs.com/#types=7,1,3,5,2,6&onlyremote=1)
Great interface to filter the remote jobs, although the majority are US based, it
states very clearly the ones that are Anywhere.

- [Remotive](http://jobs.remotive.io/)
- [Stack Overflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/uk/jobs/remote)
- [Guardian](https://jobs.theguardian.com/landingpage/2879819/jobs-remote-html/)

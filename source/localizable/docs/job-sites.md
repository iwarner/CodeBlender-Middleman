## Introduction

Trawling the many hundreds of job sites can be time consuming and non-productive.
Below I will attempt to consolidate my process in looking for a new technical job
in the UK; or more precisely in London.

Having spent twenty years in development, and most of that as a contractor. I have
learnt some ways to expedite the process of gaining visibility, searching and also
the best sites to update to gain recruiter exposure.

## CW Jobs

[CWJobs](http://www.cwjobs.co.uk/) is my go to destination when looking for a new
contract. It seems to have one of the most thorough databases, and I also believe
quality recruitment agents subscribe to the database. So when I literally update
my details I am pinged to all these recruiters for matches against the jobs they have.

The job alerts via email are also a very good option, but they do have a feature
called instant job match, which will email you a relevant job as soon as it is listed.

- [Angular](http://goo.gl/znDP1g) - London - Contract = 60 vacancies
- [PHP](http://goo.gl/oDwdpc)     - London - Contract = 22 vacancies
- [Remote](http://goo.gl/6uD3Uj)  - Contract = 67 vacancies

CW also has a nice quick apply once your profile is complete successfully.

No specific search for remote jobs unfortunately.

## TechnoJobs

[TechnoJobs](https://www.technojobs.co.uk/) registration and profile completion
on this site is easy. Giving access to a good search engine and plenty of varied
jobs across all sectors. I personally like the job alerts from this site; setting
up the following.

- [Angular](https://goo.gl/ddfYPD) - London - Contract = 28 vacancies
- [PHP](https://goo.gl/z6yVM1)     - London - Contract = 15 vacancies
- [Remote](https://goo.gl/GLNvCB)  - London - Contract = 126 vacancies

No specific search for remote jobs unfortunately.

I also like the quick apply option, powerful when the CV and cover email is already
completed.

However I have not had much traction from the jobs applied from this site. On asking
where recruiters found my details few are from here.

## Direct

A direct site is my eyes is one that acts as a recruitment in-between. Companies such
as digital agencies will post their briefs directly onto these portals and as long
as your profile matches, you will get alerted to the project.

They will then also provide timesheet and invoice processes.

[YunoJuno](https://app.yunojuno.com/p/ian-warner) is one such site. I have completed
one full contract through them and it was seamless. As long as timesheets were
completed on time I would get paid weekly.

[Elevate Direct](http://elevatedirect.com/) Similar to YJ in terms of concept. I
have however found their platform to be really buggy.

## Glass Door

[Glass Door](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/) provides more than just jobs, it is a
[company](https://goo.gl/IUk7p7) and [salary](https://goo.gl/nwmxWQ) review site also.

Found the Job search cumbersome, and was unable to bookmark the exact search from the
URL.

- [JavaScript](https://goo.gl/Ec9d1l) - London - Contract = 36 vacancies

## Indeed

[Indeed](http://www.indeed.co.uk/)

- [Remote Angular](http://goo.gl/uewqNU)              - London - Contract = 24 vacancies
- [Remote JavaScript](http://goo.gl/DQ9QCx)           - London - Contract = 491 vacancies
- [Remote JavaScript Developer](http://goo.gl/43izFg) - London - Contract = 67 vacancies

## Remote

- [Working Nomads](http://www.workingnomads.co/)
Saturated with US jobs, that usually require the candidate to be in the same timezone.
Would be great if they provided a filter for this.

- [Authentic Jobs](https://authenticjobs.com/#types=7,1,3,5,2,6&onlyremote=1)
Great interface to filter the remote jobs, although the majority are US based, it
states very clearly the ones that are Anywhere.

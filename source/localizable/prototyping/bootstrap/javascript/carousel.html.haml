    **Accessibility**

    The carousel component is generally not compliant with accessibility standards.
    If you need to be compliant, please consider other options for presenting your content.

    **Swipe**

    On many occassions you will want to add Swipe support to the bootstrap carousel.

    This can be easily achieved by adding the [JQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/)
    touch events as below to your backbone view.

        events :
            "swiperight #carouselID" : "swipeRight"
            "swipeleft  #carouselID" : "swipeLeft"

    Create the methods to handle the swipe events

        swipeRight : ( event ) ->
            $( event.currentTarget ).carousel "prev"

        swipeLeft : ( event ) ->
            $( event.currentTarget ).carousel "next"

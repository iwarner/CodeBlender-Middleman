WARBURTONS – MOTION GRAPHIC

THE BRIEF
The largest bakers in the UK chose Entyce to partner with for their customer-facing
communications strategy. They needed a series of engaging motion graphics to present
some significant market changes in the Bakery industry.

WHAT WE DID
Our visual animation team set to work creating the short film-like presentations,
incorporating on-brand illustrations and virtual reality representations of various
retail stores. A composed soundtrack was applied to the presentations that aided
the conveyance of the messages projected.

// Interface definition

/**
 
 The ESTBeacon class represents a beacon that was encountered during region monitoring. You do not create instances of this class directly. The ESTBeaconManager object reports encountered beacons to its associated delegate object. You can use the information in a beacon object to identify which beacon was encountered.
 
 
ESTBeacon class contains basic Apple CLBeacon object reference as well as some additional functionality. It allows to  connect with Estimote beacon to read / write its characteristics.

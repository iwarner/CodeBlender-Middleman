## Introduction

Having run my business as a single director / contractor for over fifteen years I
thought I would share some insight into the tools and processes I use to make sure
the accounting is not a burden.

## VAT

Simply put as an IT contractor register yourself instantly for the [Flat rate][]
scheme. Basically you invoice VAT at the normal rate, currently 20%. However each
quarter you only have to pay back approximately 14% of the vat reclaimed to HMRC.
So if your business is not constantly buying goods, but providing a service then
the savings can be significant.

If like me you want a new bit of technology then wait until you goods in mind that
total over 2000 pounds. You can then claim the VAT back on this at 20%. So that
new Mac may only cost you Â£1600 !

## Expenses

[Crunch][] provides an excellent phone application to make everyday recording of
expenses a breeze; they call it [Snap][]. Simply take a photograph of the receipt
and click upload and within hours it is usually on the [Crunch][] system.

Whilst using [Crunch][] there are a few elements that I require shortcuts for, the
first of these being creating an expense

            * Login should take an email and password combination
            * Validate effectively, with suitable password pattern
            * Make a request to the Provider for server side validation and persistent token exchange

            Authentication should include the following

            * CSRF headers in authentication requests to prevent forgery
                * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery
            * Auth state persistence through signed cookies
            * Global (singleton) session model in the client whose state changes can be listened to
            * Client-side + Server-side model validations
            * Salt/hashing of passwords for back-end storage
            * Communication on this form should happen with https.

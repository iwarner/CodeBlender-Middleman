<h1>Q&amp;A with Courtney McNeil, Brand Design Lead</h1>
<p>We spoke to our Brand Design Lead, Courtney McNeil to get the inside scoop on our new look.</p>

<p>What prompted this new look?</p>

<p>Our last logo was produced when Deliveroo was a small start-up based only in London. The logo didn't provide the flexibility and functionality we needed as the company grew and expanded into new markets. The logo was complex, outlined in black and couldn't be used directly on our core colour, teal.</p>

<p>We evaluated the mark within different countries to look into cultural associations and sensitivities and found that the old kangaroo was viewed differently in other cultures, and given its white colour could be mistaken for a mouse or bunny rabbit – not the best association for a food company!</p>

<p>Explain the new Roo Mark</p>
<p><img alt="Deliveroo" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xPHeY75s9AylrP2q6AD9ayZZxTtmo2WgsdG0XDPCieVzvanVxJvrSWRA-2HRbqGaFRAX9H35NuaK7nBkxGVb3s8R83jT_vpyaZZ-iundaCk-Y6UxxuVlaxO8WEDSFU_68z3CHL-3" class="img-responsive"></p>

<p>There were two approaches we looked into: 1. Revolution – which would mean starting from scratch, or 2. Evolution – keeping the spirit of the current brand and channeling it in a direction that suited us.</p>

<p>Ultimately we decided on approach 2 : Evolution. The 'roo' had become a symbol that everyone related to, it was friendly and cute, and we wanted to retain the personality that resonated so strongly.</p>

<p>We retained the spirit of the logo, by keeping the 'Roo', but simplified it, making it bolder and more confident and allowing flexibility to use the mark in numerous formats, from apps to billboards, menus to emails.</p>

<p>The Roo Mark is a bold, fresh symbol to own our food revolution. The Roo Mark looks simple, but we produced files and files of content and thousands of iterations before we nailed the new 'Roo' down and until we felt it represented everything we stand for at Deliveroo – energy, service, quality and awesomeness.</p>

<p>Will we still be using teal?</p>

<p>Yes! Teal is still our core colour, and a huge part of our brand's cultural DNA, but we have created a much wider colour palette that's as diverse as the food we serve and will help to highlight it to its best advantage. From warm orange 'pumpkin', to subtle 'anchovy and punchy 'pimiento', it gives us the freedom to express the energy and dynamism of great food in fresh, exciting ways.</p>

<p>How do restaurants fit into this new, bold style?</p>

<p>Restaurant spotlight marketing is a huge opportunity for us to focus and champion consumers' favourite dishes. Our new colour palette and diverse graphic style can flex to fit restaurants.</p>

<p>We have developed a number of ways to do so – utilising our brand blocks and building on our graphic system, incorporating bright colours and integrating copy that highlights specific, enticing dishes – or using witty situational copy that will resonate with our audience.</p>

<p>We've developed a suite of assets for restaurants to use, from co branded business cards to stickers and bill flyers.</p>

<p>And imagery?</p>

<p>Our image style is bold and bright, setting out to hero our favourite foods, evoke emotions and seriously stir the tastebuds – highlighting the calibre of restaurants on our platform.  From right up close, to zooming out on the scene, picturing the places where awesome food is enjoyed.</p>
